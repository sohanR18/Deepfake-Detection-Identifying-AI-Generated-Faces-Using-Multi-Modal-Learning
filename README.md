# Deepfake-Detection-Identifying-AI-Generated-Faces-Using-Multi-Modal-Learning
This project uses Vision Transformers and FFT-based analysis to detect deepfakes by combining spatial and frequency features. It includes a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) and references to the datasets (FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, DFDC) used for training and evaluation.
